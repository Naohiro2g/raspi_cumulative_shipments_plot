Eben described how frustrating it was in the early 2000s when the number of computer science applicants to the University of Cambridge, where he worked, was declining, and students coming through with good enough programming skills were in danger of becoming extinct. He wanted to create a computer of the kind that had inspired him back in the 1980s — namely, the BBC Micro — so he set about designing the first Raspberry Pi, in the hope of selling as many as 10,000 units if things went really well. Almost eleven years later, we’ve sold around 50 million.
